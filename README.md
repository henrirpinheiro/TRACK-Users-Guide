## 🛠️ Project Overview

TRACK is an automated feature-tracking algorithm developed by Dr. Kevin Hodges at the University of Reading (UK). The codebase combines C and Fortran, and is compatible with most Linux-based systems using the Bash shell.

🔍 Main Features¶
Tracks features based on vorticity, pressure, or other fields
Custom thresholds for intensity, displacement, and lifetime
Outputs detailed track files and summary statistics
Includes spatial kernel estimators and lifecycle compositing tools
TRACK has been widely used for analyzing tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, cut-off lows, and other synoptic-scale systems. It identifies and tracks meteorological and oceanic features—such as vorticity centers or sea-level pressure—based on user-defined criteria.

This tool enables the processing of large datasets, applicable to both reanalysis and model simulations (including present-day climate simulations and future projections). It offers flexibility for customization and produces a range of outputs, including track density maps, intensity distributions, and composite structure and lifecycle.
